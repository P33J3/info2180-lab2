              </div>
              <p>There are many reasons why you should drink coffee&#44; even some based on science&#46;
                  But we are going to keep things on a level and instead list my top 5 reasons
                  why everyone should drink coffee&#46;
              </p>
                    <ul id="coffeelist">
                        <li>It tastes good&#46;</li>
                        <li>The aroma is the best thing to greet you in the morning&#46;</li>
                        <li>There&#8217;s a roast for every mood&#46;</li>
                        <li>Apart from water&#44; with coffee you don&#39;t need another drink&#46;</li>
                        <li>It tastes good when hot or cold&#46;</li>
                    </ul>

                 <p> No I am not going to bore you with explanations of each reason&#46; Instead&#44; I would love for you to have
                a cuppa as soon as you can&#46; Just make sure you ask for decaf if it&#39;s your first time&#46; If you already know
              what I am talking about&#44; how about you try a new roast or flavour&#46;
              Pumpkin Spiced Lattes will be there this time of year&#44; every year&#46; My personal favourite is a custom blend
              of Chickory&#44; Cloves and Cinnamon&#46; Sweet and spicy like my favourite Chinese dish&#46;&#46;&#46; I digress&#46;
                </p>
              <p>
                  You see&#44; I&#8217;m so in love with coffee that I believe you will too and no it&#8217;s not because of
                  the caffiene&#46; Coffee is just one of those simple joys in life that warms the soul&#46;
                  While I am convinced that you&#39;re already in agreement with me and you&#8217;re ready to head to the
                  nearest caf&#233;&#44; please bear in mind that I too would like a cup&#46;
                  Cheers&#46;

            <p>Like learning to ride a bicycle or tying your shoe laces&#44; the feeling of accomplishment you get once
                you have done these things puts you in another realm of confidence&#46; But these things my friend&#44;
                are child&#8217;s play when compared to mastering a recipe unique to your own taste buds&#46;</p>
            <p>Following the basic recipe is easy&#46; Usually a tablespoon of ground coffee&#44; but do you prefer
                it medium or coarse&#63; Then you add 6oz of water and wait 4 minutes&#44; but do you like your flavour
                bold&#44; mild or slightly bitter which seems just right when you&#39;re adding some condensed milk to
                it&#46; You see&#63; Like Goldilocks we want it just right&#46;</p>
            <p>Once you&#39;ve found the right combination for you&#44; you&#39;ll see how proficient you get making your
                cuppa while still half asleep&#46; When you feel comfortable and if you so choose&#44; play around with
                spices and blends to find that unique taste that makes you sigh with exquisite joy&#46; Cheers&#46;</p>
